To use the diagram view toggle functionality:

1. MENU BAR:
   - Go to View ‚Üí Diagram View
   - Click to toggle the diagram view on/off
   - The menu item will show a checkmark when active

2. TOOLBAR:
   - Look for the "Diagram View" button in the toolbar
   - Click to toggle the diagram view on/off
   - The button will appear pressed when active

3. SYNCHRONIZATION:
   - Both the menu and toolbar buttons stay synchronized
   - Clicking either one will update both

4. DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:
   - Diagram view is hidden by default when the application starts
   - You need to explicitly toggle it on to see it

5. DOCK BEHAVIOR:
   - When toggled on, the diagram view appears as a dock widget
   - It can be moved, resized, or undocked like other panels
   - When toggled off, it's completely hidden
